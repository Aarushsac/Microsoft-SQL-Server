When we create a datapoint or a record we sometimes don't insert all the records in the table we just put a specific number of columns which we want
that time when other columns are left empty NULL values get stored in them

So we when retrieving records and comparing column values to NULL have to use a special operator called IS to verify if it is NULL or not
