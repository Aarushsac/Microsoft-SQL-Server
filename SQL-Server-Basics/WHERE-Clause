WHERE CLAUSE

This is used for filtering out records from a table

Important to note is that WHERE CLAUSE is executed before the SELECT statement

First the table gets loaded, then the records are filtered and then the columns which needed to be brought are retrieved

SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Employees]
WHERE EmployeeID = 2

SELECT EmployeeID FROM [dbo].[Employees]
WHERE Salary > 60000.00
